### **2019 Bay Wheels Ride Data Exploration and Visualization**

#### Introduction
Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. There are two types of clients using the system: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm. Customers are usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area.

#### Summary of Findings

- Both users prefer using a bike to go to work and to leave work and also in the afternoon they use bikes to go to restaurants or cafes.
- On weekdays the usage level is higher than at weekends for subscribers but customer usage shows that approximately the same level all week.
- The average trip time is approximately 15 minutes.
- Customer usage trend increases towards the end of the year. On the other hand, subscriber usage trend gets the least level in the whole year.
- Subscribers use bikes for a short time period than customers.
- There are no regular trends in a year. Subscriber usage seems that they are the least ride at the end of the year this situation maybe because of the Christmas holiday, they have a holiday and do not have to go to work. On the other hand, customer usage shows that the highest level in December for them.
- Subscribers ride much shorter/quicker trips compared to customers on each day of the week. Both user types have an obvious increase in trip duration on Saturdays and Sundays over weekends. Subscribers usage seems to maintain a very consistent average duration Monday through Friday.
